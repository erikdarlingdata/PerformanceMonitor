## Quick Start — Full Edition

### Install

Windows Authentication:

```
PerformanceMonitorInstaller.exe YourServerName
```

SQL Authentication:

```
PerformanceMonitorInstaller.exe YourServerName sa YourPassword
```

Clean reinstall (drops existing database and all collected data):

```
PerformanceMonitorInstaller.exe YourServerName --reinstall
PerformanceMonitorInstaller.exe YourServerName sa YourPassword --reinstall
```

The installer automatically tests the connection, executes SQL scripts, downloads community dependencies, creates SQL Agent jobs, and runs initial data collection. A GUI installer (`InstallerGui/`) is also available with the same functionality.

### CLI Installer Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `SERVER` | SQL Server instance name (positional, required) |
| `USERNAME PASSWORD` | SQL Authentication credentials (positional, optional) |
| `--reinstall` | Drop existing database and perform clean install |
| `--encrypt=optional\|mandatory\|strict` | Connection encryption level (default: mandatory) |
| `--trust-cert` | Trust server certificate without validation (default: require valid cert) |

**Environment variable:** Set `PM_SQL_PASSWORD` to avoid passing the password on the command line.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Invalid arguments |
| `2` | Connection failed |
| `3` | Critical file failed (scripts 01–03) |
| `4` | Partial installation (non-critical failures) |
| `5` | Version check failed |
| `6` | SQL files not found |

### Post-Installation

1. Ensure SQL Server Agent is running — the collection job executes every minute
2. Verify installation:

```sql
SELECT * FROM PerformanceMonitor.config.current_version;

SELECT TOP (20) *
FROM PerformanceMonitor.config.collection_log
ORDER BY collection_time DESC;
```

3. Launch the Dashboard (`Dashboard/` folder — build with `dotnet build` or use the release package). The Dashboard is a separate WPF application that runs on your workstation and connects to any SQL Server where the PerformanceMonitor database is installed. Add your server, enter credentials, and data appears immediately.

### What Gets Installed

- **PerformanceMonitor database** with collection tables and reporting views
- **30 collector stored procedures** for gathering metrics (including SQL Agent job monitoring)
- **Delta framework** for calculating per-second rates from cumulative DMVs
- **Community dependencies:** sp_WhoIsActive, sp_HealthParser, sp_HumanEventsBlockViewer, sp_BlitzLock
- **SQL Agent jobs:** Collection (every 1 minute), Data Retention (daily at 2:00 AM), and Hung Job Monitor (collection job watchdog, every 5 minutes)
- **Version tracking** in `config.installation_history`

### Data Retention

Default: 30 days (configurable per table in `config.retention_settings`).

Storage estimates: 5–10 GB per week, 20–40 GB per month.

### Managed Platform Support

The Full Edition supports Azure SQL Managed Instance and AWS RDS for SQL Server with some limitations:

| Feature | On-Premises | Azure SQL MI | AWS RDS |
|---|---|---|---|
| All core collectors | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Default trace collectors | Yes | Disabled automatically | Yes |
| System health XE (file target) | Yes | Disabled automatically | Yes |
| SQL Trace collectors | Yes | Disabled automatically | Yes |
| SQL Agent jobs | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Running jobs collector | Yes | Yes | Disabled automatically |
| Blocked process threshold | Auto-configured | Auto-configured | Configure via RDS parameter group |
| sp_configure | Yes | Yes | Not available |

**Azure SQL MI:** The installer automatically detects Engine Edition 8 and disables 4 collectors that require file system access or SQL Trace (default_trace, trace_management, trace_analysis, system_health). All other collectors work normally.

**AWS RDS:** The installer automatically detects the `rdsadmin` database and disables the `running_jobs_collector` (requires `msdb.dbo.syssessions` which is restricted on RDS). It also gracefully handles restricted `sp_configure` and limited `msdb` permissions. SQL Agent jobs are created and owned by the installing login. The RDS master user is automatically enrolled in `SQLAgentUserRole`; for other logins, add them to `SQLAgentUserRole` in msdb before running the installer.

### AWS RDS Parameter Group Configuration

`sp_configure` is not available on AWS RDS for SQL Server. Features that depend on server-level configuration must be set through **AWS RDS Parameter Groups** instead.

**Blocked process threshold** — Required for blocked process report collection. Without this, blocked process reports will not fire on RDS.

1. Open the [AWS RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) and navigate to **Parameter groups**
2. Create a new parameter group (or modify the one attached to your instance):
   - Family: `sqlserver-ee-16.0` (or your edition/version)
   - Type: DB Parameter Group
3. Search for `blocked process threshold (s)` and set it to `5` (seconds)
4. Apply the parameter group to your RDS instance (may require a reboot if the parameter is static)
5. Verify it took effect:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.name,
       c.value_in_use
   FROM sys.configurations AS c
   WHERE c.name = N'blocked process threshold (s)';
   ```

**Deadlocks** — No parameter group configuration is required. The SQL Server deadlock monitor runs automatically on all platforms, and the `xml_deadlock_report` Extended Event fires without any threshold setting.

**Azure SQL Database** — The blocked process threshold is fixed at 20 seconds and cannot be changed. The `blocked_process_report` event fires automatically when blocking exceeds this duration.

---

## Alerts & Notifications

Both editions include a real-time alert engine that monitors for performance issues and sends notifications via system tray balloons and email.

### Alert Types

| Metric | Default Threshold | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Blocking** | 30 seconds (Full), 5 seconds (Lite) | Fires when the longest blocked session exceeds the threshold |
| **Deadlocks** | 1 | Fires when new deadlocks are detected since the last check |
| **High CPU** | 90% (Full), 80% (Lite) | Fires when total CPU (SQL + other) exceeds the threshold |
| **Connection changes** | N/A | Fires when a monitored server goes offline or comes back online |

All thresholds are configurable in Settings.

### Notification Channels

- **System tray** — balloon notifications with 5-minute per-metric cooldown
- **Email (SMTP)** — styled HTML emails with 15-minute per-metric cooldown, configurable SMTP settings (server, port, SSL, authentication, recipients)

### Email Alerts

Alert emails include:

- **Metric summary** — what triggered the alert, current value vs threshold
- **Detail section** — recent blocking chains or deadlock participants with query text, wait times, lock modes, database names, and client application
- **XML attachment** — full `blocked_process_report.xml` or `deadlock_graph.xml` for offline analysis

### Alert Behavior

- **Resolved notifications** — when a condition clears (e.g., blocking ends), a "Cleared" notification fires
- **Server silencing** — right-click a server tab to acknowledge alerts, silence all alerts, or unsilence
- **Always-on** — the Dashboard alert engine runs independently of which tab is active, including when minimized to the system tray. The Lite edition's alert engine also runs regardless of tab visibility.
- **Alert history** — Dashboard keeps an in-memory alert log (accessible via MCP). Lite logs alerts to DuckDB (`config_alert_log`).

---

## Agent Job Monitoring

Both editions monitor currently running SQL Agent jobs and flag jobs that are running longer than expected.

| Metric | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Current duration** | Elapsed time since the job started |
| **Average duration** | Historical mean from successful completions in `msdb.dbo.sysjobhistory` |
| **p95 duration** | 95th percentile from historical completions |
| **Running long flag** | Set when current duration exceeds the p95 threshold |

The Full Edition collects this data via the `collect.running_jobs_collector` stored procedure (every 5 minutes). The Lite Edition queries `msdb` directly on each collection cycle. Both editions expose this data through the MCP `get_running_jobs` tool.

Gracefully skipped on Azure SQL Database, AWS RDS for SQL Server, and environments without SQL Server Agent.

---

## MCP Server (LLM Integration)

Both editions include an embedded [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes monitoring data to LLM clients like Claude Code and Cursor.

### Setup

1. Enable the MCP server in Settings (checkbox + port, default `5151`)
2. Register with Claude Code:

```
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user sql-monitor http://localhost:5151/
```

3. Open a new Claude Code session and ask questions like:
   - "What servers are being monitored?"
   - "What are the top wait types on my server?"
   - "Are there any blocking or deadlock issues?"
   - "Show me CPU utilization for the last 4 hours"
   - "What are the most expensive queries by CPU?"

### Available Tools

Full Edition exposes 27 tools, Lite Edition exposes 31. Core tools are shared across both editions.

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Discovery | `list_servers` |
| Health | `get_server_summary`\*, `get_daily_summary`\*\*, `get_collection_health` |
| Alerts | `get_alert_history`, `get_alert_settings` |
| Waits | `get_wait_stats`, `get_wait_types`\*, `get_wait_trend`, `get_waiting_tasks`\* |
| Queries | `get_top_queries_by_cpu`, `get_top_procedures_by_cpu`, `get_query_store_top`, `get_expensive_queries`\*\*, `get_query_duration_trend`\*, `get_query_trend` |
| CPU | `get_cpu_utilization` |
| Memory | `get_memory_stats`, `get_memory_trend`, `get_memory_clerks`, `get_memory_grants` |
| Blocking | `get_blocking`\*\*, `get_deadlocks`, `get_deadlock_detail`, `get_blocked_process_reports`\*, `get_blocked_process_xml`, `get_blocking_deadlock_stats`\*\*, `get_blocking_trend`\*, `get_deadlock_trend`\* |
| I/O | `get_file_io_stats`, `get_file_io_trend` |
| TempDB | `get_tempdb_trend` |
| Perfmon | `get_perfmon_stats`, `get_perfmon_trend` |
| Jobs | `get_running_jobs`\* |

\* Lite only | \*\* Full only

Most tools accept optional `server_name` and `hours_back` parameters. If only one server is configured, `server_name` is auto-resolved.

The MCP server binds to `localhost` only and does not accept remote connections.

---

## Performance Impact

### On Monitored Servers

- All queries use `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation
- Configurable collection intervals
- Full Edition: typical overhead <1% CPU, <100 MB memory
- Lite Edition: max 7 concurrent SQL connections, 30-second command timeout

### Local Resources (Lite)

- DuckDB: ~50–200 MB per server per week
- Parquet archives: ~10x compression with ZSTD
- ScottPlot charts use hardware-accelerated rendering

---

## Troubleshooting

### Full Edition

Two diagnostic scripts in the `install/` folder:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `99_installer_troubleshooting.sql` | Quick health checks: collection log errors, schedule status, Agent job status, table row counts |
| `99_user_troubleshooting.sql` | Comprehensive diagnostics: runs collectors with `@debug = 1`, detailed timing and row counts |

```sql
SELECT
    collection_time,
    collector_name,
    error_message
FROM PerformanceMonitor.config.collection_log
WHERE collection_status = 'ERROR'
ORDER BY collection_time DESC;
```

### Lite Edition

Application logs are written to the `logs/` folder. Collection success/failure is also logged to the `collection_log` table in DuckDB.

Common issues:

1. **No data after connecting** — Wait for the first collection cycle (1–5 minutes). Check logs for connection errors.
2. **Query Store tab empty** — Query Store must be enabled on the target database (`ALTER DATABASE [YourDB] SET QUERY_STORE = ON`).
3. **Blocked process reports empty** — Both editions attempt to auto-configure the blocked process threshold to 5 seconds via `sp_configure`. On **AWS RDS**, `sp_configure` is not available — you must set `blocked process threshold (s)` through an RDS Parameter Group (see "AWS RDS Parameter Group Configuration" above). On **Azure SQL Database**, the threshold is fixed at 20 seconds and cannot be changed. If you still see no data on other platforms, verify the login has `ALTER SETTINGS` permission.
4. **Connection failures** — Verify network connectivity, firewall rules, and that the login has `VIEW SERVER STATE`.
