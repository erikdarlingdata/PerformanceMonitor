    /// <para><b>The regime.</b> Nothing encloses these: <c>ProcessServerSweepAsync</c> runs on the plain
    /// stopping token, with no <c>CancelAfter</c> anywhere between the 15 s launch tick and the
    /// collector call. What the body DOES hold is scarce — one of <c>max_concurrent_sweeps</c> permits
    /// and, post-#2822, one borrowed store connection out of <c>MaxPoolSize = 24</c>, both for its whole
    /// duration — and the 60 s <c>DarlingWorker.SweepWatchdogSeconds</c> only LOGS, so nothing
    /// interrupts a stalled body. The per-command deadline is the only bound that exists.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>ABOVE the measured worst case.</b> The store-write half of every collector run is
    /// already instrumented as <c>collection_log.store_duration_ms</c>. Over 24 h on the busiest server
    /// of the larger production fleet (43 servers, a 305 GB store ingesting ~15-20 GB/day) the worst of
    /// 200 runs was <b>1.53 s</b> — <c>query_store</c> writing 11,614 rows as a per-database batch
    /// sequence. Fleet-wide, the per-run store-write average across all 39 collectors on both
    /// production stores tops out at <b>1,511 ms</b> (<c>index_object_stats</c>, ~21,090 rows/run) with
    /// most collectors in the single-digit-to-low-tens ms. On top of that sits store connection
    /// acquisition, measured at <b>673-893 ms</b> in #2819. So ~2.4 s covers the worst thing actually
    /// observed, and 10 s keeps ~4x headroom over it.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>BELOW the point where the deadline costs more than it saves</b>, and the bound is the
    /// 60 s watchdog rather than a cadence, because the body runs its due collectors SEQUENTIALLY. Real
    /// cycles on that same server span 13 s (a light tick) to 48 s (a tick including
    /// <c>query_store</c>). One blown deadline on a 48 s cycle lands at 58 s and stays under the
    /// watchdog; one blown 30 s DEFAULT lands at 78 s and manufactures a "collection body has not
    /// completed after 60s" warning on a body that is merely slow. Keeping a single overshoot inside the
    /// watchdog is what stops this change from re-creating the #1581/#2170 warning herd.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>Why it is derived at <c>max_concurrent_sweeps</c> = 8, not the seeded 4.</b> The knob
    /// (V59, clamped 1-16) is going from 4 to 8, which doubles the bodies in flight and therefore the
    /// concurrent store connections the sweep holds — the pool is NOT the binding constraint at either
    /// width (borrowing put peak demand at the sweep width itself, and
    /// <c>DarlingManagedPostgres</c>'s own note establishes even 16-wide fits inside 24 with the
    /// seams), but the DURATION of a stalled hold is: C bodies each stalled T seconds withhold C x T
    /// connection-seconds from retention, alerting and observability. At the 30 s default and C = 8 that
    /// is 8 of 24 connections held for 30 s, a third of the pool, against a sixth at C = 4. So the
    /// floor above was doubled before the headroom was taken — 1.53 s of measured store write projected
    /// to ~3.1 s if write latency scaled linearly with twice the concurrent writers, plus ~0.9 s of
    /// acquisition, is the ~4.0 s that 10 s is set to clear. <b>The value is correct at 8 and at 16;
    /// it was chosen so that raising the knob does not invalidate it.</b></para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>What this is NOT derived from.</b> Not the 120 s <c>PerItemWallClockBudget</c>
    /// abandonment tail — that was root-caused to external contention on the monitored target
    /// (confined to 2 of 43 servers, load-invariant across a 6.1x cadence increase: runs x6.1,
    /// abandonments x1.11), so a store-side deadline is not the lever for it. And not
    /// <c>collector_cost.max_sql_ms</c>, which on a budgeted collector is CENSORED by that same 120 s
